# Broken App Issues

- there was no error handling

  - added a general error handler as well as a 404 error handler

- inconsistencies using let/const and var variable

  - changed var to const and changed let variables to const to be more appropriate in syntax

- changed object/mapping to be more syntax-friendly and easier to read for future coders
  - added comments
